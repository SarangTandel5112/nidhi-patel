                                        Hi, my name is Nidhi Patel and I started
                                        my career by working for a startup that
                                        used to sell exotic plants but soon my
                                        "first job" turned into a Passion
                                        Project!! Well there has been no turning
                                        back since! Digging into "Why not?" has
                                        been the dearest task to me. I always
                                        have a zillion questions about the
                                        product, for the stakeholders and
                                        myself! The courage to question
                                        everything has helped me deliver the
                                        most impactful work. I always look
                                        forward to working with growing
                                        companies, it makes me feel that I am
                                        part of something that is on its way of
                                        becoming something great!!!
                                    </p>
